Summary: Let me tell you how I set up this blog using a 
static site generator called Pelican, and used Amazon S3 
and Cloudflare to store the generated HTML files and route 
my domain name to the static files respectively.
Status: draft

When I decided to make this blog, I looked into setting up 
a virtual private server or a cloud service to host it. 
However, these services seemed too complicated for what 
I wanted to do and didn't seem to be worth the time and 
money.
